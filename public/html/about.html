<h3>About me</h3>
<img class='Profile' src='./public/img/dmitry.jpg' alt='photo of Dmitry' /> 
<p>
    I'm an engineer, product thinker and futurist.
    <br />
    <br />
    Professionally, I've worked on building large-scale developer platforms, productivity software and blockchain applications.
    At the same time, I've shipped a number of interesting <a href="/projects">developer tools and social networks</a> on my own.
    <br />
    <br />
    I'm excited by opportunities to create technology that addresses meaningful problems for everyday people.
    I believe software can augment our lives for the better and make individuals more empowered, productive and connected.
