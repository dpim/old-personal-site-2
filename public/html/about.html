<h3>About me</h3>
<img class='Profile' src='./public/img/finland.jpg' alt='photo of Dmitry' /> 
<p>
    I'm a product person that enjoys crafting experiences that unlock new possibilities for others. 
    I've shipped a number of developer tools and social networks (see <a href="/projects">Projects</a>).
    Professionally, I get excited about challenging assumptions about how technologies should work and strive to build tools that are elegant, observable and human-centric.
