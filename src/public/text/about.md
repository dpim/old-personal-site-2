I'm an engineer, product thinker and futurist. Professionally, I've worked on building large-scale developer platforms, productivity software and blockchain applications.
At the same time, I've built a few [developer tools and social networks](/projects) of my own.

I love crafting new products, working through thorny problems and all the learning that comes along the way.
