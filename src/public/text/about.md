I'm a product thinker, engineer and tinkerer. Professionally, I've worked on building large-scale developer platforms, productivity software and blockchain applications.
At the same time, I've built a few [developer tools and social networks](/projects) of my own.

Currently, I'm most interested in:

- Building and scaling platforms
- Workflow automation and productivity
- Simplifying payments and money movement
- Creating the next wave of social products
