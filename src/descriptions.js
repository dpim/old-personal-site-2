    I like building things that unlock new possibilities for others. This can take many shapes -- from enabling developers to build solutions more efficiently, to connecting people that wouldn't otherwise meet via an iPhone app. At the intersection of engineering and product, I have a holistic understanding of the development process and experience shipping end-to-end. \
